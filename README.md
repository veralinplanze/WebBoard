# WebBoard
## WebBoard is a simple web application that would allow you to pin your notes on a remote web server.
### I develop this application as my university project along with studying such technologies as:
* git
* Java programming language
* mustache template maker
* Spring Framework 2.7.2 (Boot, JPA, Security and etc.)
* Maven Build Tools
* DBMS (PostgreSQL along with pgAdmin4 tool)
* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
